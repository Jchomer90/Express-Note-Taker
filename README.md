  ## Description

  Using Express and Node js - Express Note Taker will allow the user to save notes and save them to the local server. When they no longer need the note, they can simply delete. 

  With a significant amount of starter code, I was responsible for creating a javascript file to provide functionality. It was necessary to use express in order to get routes, post notes and delete notes - using file system to read and write notes.
